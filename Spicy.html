<h1>Easy Chicken Curry</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p> <ul>
  <li>1 large onion</li>
  <li>6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>50g ginger, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
  <li>2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp fennel seeds</li>
  <li>5cm cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
  <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
  <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
  <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
  <li>8 chicken thighs, skinned, boneless (about 800g)</li>
  <li>250ml hot chicken stock</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped coriander</li>
</ul> </p>
<h2> Steps <h2/>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Roughly chop 1 large onion, transfer to a small food processor, and add 3 tbsp of water - process to a slack paste. You could use a stick blender for this or coarsely grate the onion into a bowl â€“ thereâ€™s no need to add any water if you are grating the onion. Tip into a small bowl and leave on one side.</li>
  <li>Put 6 roughly chopped garlic cloves and 50g roughly chopped ginger into the same food processor and add 4 tbsp water â€“ process until smooth and spoon into another small bowl. Alternatively, crush the garlic to a paste with a knife or garlic press and finely grate the ginger.</li>
  <li>Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in a wok or sturdy pan set over a medium heat.</li>
  <li>Combine 2 tsp cumin seeds and 1 tsp fennel seeds with a 5cm cinnamon stick and 1 tsp chilli flakes and add to the pan in one go. Swirl everything around for about 30 secs until the spices release a fragrant aroma.</li>
  <li>Add the onion paste â€“ it will splutter in the beginning. Fry until the water evaporates and the onions turn a lovely dark golden - this should take about 7-8 mins.</li>
  <li>Add the garlic and ginger paste and cook for another 2 mins â€“ stirring all the time.</li>
  <li>Stir in 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp caster sugar and continue cooking for 20 secs before tipping in a 400g can chopped tomatoes.</li>
  <li>Continue cooking on a medium heat for about 10 mins without a lid until the tomatoes reduce and darken.</li>
  <li>Cut 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs into 3cm chunks and add to the pan once the tomatoes have thickened to a paste.</li>
  <li>Cook for 5 mins to coat the chicken in the masala and seal in the juices, and then pour over 250ml hot chicken stock.</li>
  <li>Simmer for 8-10 mins without a lid until the chicken is tender and the masala lightly thickened â€“ you might need to add an extra ladleful of stock or water if the curry needs it.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with 2 tbsp chopped coriander and serve with Indian flatbreads or fluffy basmati rice and a pot of yogurt on the side.</li>
</ol>
